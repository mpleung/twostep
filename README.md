This repository contains code used in the paper "Two-Step Estimation of Network-Formation Models with Incomplete Information" by Michael Leung. 

The sections below explain some of what you see in this directory. Some of the files described only appear after running main.m. Before using the code, you will need to change [PATH] in main.m, latextables.m, misc.m, and visualizenetwork.r to the actual directory path of this folder. 

1.'raw_data' folder
Obtain data from http://www.stanford.edu/~jacksonm/IndianVillagesDataFiles.zip. After unzipping, put the contents of the folder '2010-0760_Data' directly into this folder.

2. 'code' folder
a. Run main.m to generate data, estimate the model, and compute the asymptotic variance. 
b. misc.m contains code for creating summary statistics and exporting characteristics for use in visualizenetwork.r
c. visualizenetwork.r generates visual representations of the networks. Its output is saved in 'lendmoney graphs'.
d. latextables.m is used to generate the tables of parameter estimates in the paper.

3. 'directed_adjacency_matrices' folder
This contains 'lendmoney' and 'rel' csvs generated from drop_notype_all.m in the 'code' folder. It also contains adjacency matrix csvs generated by gendirected.m.

4. 'dMU' folder
This contains output from dMU.m.

5. 'lendmoney_graphs' folder
This contains output from visualizenetwork.r.

6. 'results' folder
This contains output from twostepest.m and avar.m.

7. other files
a. X.mat in the root folder is generated by format_covariates.m.
b. ind_char_subset.tab is a custom zip file taken from the microfinance project website http://economics.mit.edu/faculty/eduflo/social. Its columns are pid hhid resp_gend resp_status age religion caste subcaste mothertongue kannada tamil telugu hindi urdu english educ res_time_yrs work_freq work_freq_type shgparticipate savings
